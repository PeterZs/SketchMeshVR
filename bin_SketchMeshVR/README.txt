NOTE: When using this on a laptop, please plug in the power supply to ensure optimal performance.
All editing actions are performed by pressing and holding down the TRIGGER button (at your index finger) of the right controller.
The default action is the DRAW mode, which allows you to create a mesh.
When you want to start a new mesh, simply start drawing over the current one, it will be removed as soon as you start. 

Laser usage: ADD, REMOVE, CUT, EXTRUDE (first part), TYPE CHANGE
Tip-of-finger usage: DRAW, PULL, EXTRUDE (second part), SMOOTH

All of the modes below can be selected from the menu, which can be brought up by pressing the A button. Modes can be selected from the menu by aiming at them and then pressing either the B button or the TRIGGER button.
* DRAW: Press and hold down the TRIGGER button and draw the shape. You don't need to fully close the shape, as this will be done for you. The outline is not allowed to intersect itself. The sofware will interpret the outline as if it was drawn in 2D on a whiteboard that best fits your drawn stroke.
* ADD: Press and hold down the TRIGGER button and either draw the new curve entirely on the mesh surface, or start and end outside of the mesh. When the stroke starts and ends outside of the mesh, the stroke will wrap around over the backside of the mesh (like a cut stroke).
* REMOVE: Point at the curve you want to remove and press the TRIGGER button. The selected stroke will show up in black. Point at the same stroke and press again to confirm its removal. 
* PULL: Hold your hand close to the curve you want to deform and press and hold down the TRIGGER button. Pull the curve to the desired shape by moving your hand. When your hand is too far away from any of the control curves, nothing will happen. NOTE: large deformations will result in the entire mesh being translated. To avoid this, break up large deformations into multiple smaller ones and release the TRIGGER button in between.
* CUT: Aim the laser outside of the mesh, then press and hold down the TRIGGER button and draw a cut stroke over the mesh as if you are cutting with a laser sword. Make sure to start and end the cut stroke outside of the mesh. After drawing the cutting stroke, point at the mesh part that you want to remove and press the TRIGGER button to remove it.
* EXTRUDE: First draw the extrusion base entirely on the mesh surface while holding down the TRIGGER button (it is possible to draw over existing curves). When this is successful, it will show up in blue. Then, using the position of your hand, press and hold down the TRIGGER button and draw the extrusion silhouette. This silhouette will be attached to the extrusion base. 
* TYPE CHANGE: Point at the control curve whose type you want to change from sharp to smooth or vice versa and press the TRIGGER button.
* SAVE: Selecting the save mode will open a pop-up screen on the monitor of the PC that the Oculus Rift is attached to. This pop-up asks for the location where you want to save the mesh. Use the keyboard and/or mouse to give input.
* LOAD: Selecting the load mode will open a pop-up screen on the monitor of the PC that the Oculus Rift is attached to. This pop-up asks for the file that you want to load a mesh from. Use the keyboard and/or mouse to give input.

In addition the the modes that can be selected in the menu, the user can also smooth the mesh or individual curves. In order to smooth the complete mesh, you press the B button while holding your hand away from the mesh. In order to smooth an individual control curve, hold your hand close to the curve you want to smooth, and then while holding down the B button rub over the curve in order to smooth it.
Finally the user can rotate the mesh in space by moving the right thumbstick.
