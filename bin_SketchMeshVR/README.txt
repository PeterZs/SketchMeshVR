All editing actions are performed by pressing and holding down the trigger button (at your index finger) of the right controller.
The default action is the "draw" mode, which allows you to create a mesh.
Press A to bring up the menu. Point with the right controller and select a different action by either pressing the B button or the right trigger. Pressing A again will close the menu.
To rotate the mesh, use the right thumbstick. 
When you want to start a new mesh, simply start drawing over the current one, it will be removed as soon as you start.

NOTE: due to the fact that the tip of the index finger is used as "drawing point", drawing valid extrusion silhouettes is very hard and extrusion will almost certainly crash the program. Stay away from it for now.
