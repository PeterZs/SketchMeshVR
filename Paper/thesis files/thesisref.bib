@article{Sorkine2006,
abstract = {Surface representation and processing is one of the key topics in computer graphics and geometric modeling, since it greatly affects the range of possible applications. In this paper we will present recent advances in geometry processing that are related to the Laplacian processing framework and differential representations. This framework is based on linear operators defined on polygonal meshes, and furnishes a variety of processing applications, such as shape approximation and compact representation, mesh editing, watermarking and morphing. The core of the framework is the definition of differential coordinates and new bases for efficient mesh geometry representation, based on the mesh Laplacian operator.},

@article{Nealen2007,
abstract = {This paper presents a system for designing freeform surfaces with a collection of 3D curves. The user first creates a rough 3D model by using a sketching interface. Unlike previous sketching systems, the user-drawn strokes stay on the model surface and serve as handles for controlling the geometry. The user can add, remove, and deform these control curves easily, as if working with a 2D line drawing. The curves can have arbitrary topology; they need not be connected to each other. For a given set of curves, the system automatically constructs a smooth surface embedding by applying functional optimization. Our system provides real-time algorithms for both control curve deformation and the subsequent surface optimization. We show that one can create sophisticated models using this system, which have not yet been seen in previous sketching or functional optimization systems.},

@article{Fu2007,
abstract = {Laplacian coordinates as a local shape descriptor have been employed in mesh editing. As they are encoded in the global coordinate system, they need to be transformed locally to reflect the changed local features of the deformed surface. We present a novel implicit Laplacian editing framework which is linear and effectively captures local rotation information during editing. Directly representing rotation with respect to vertex positions in 3D space leads to a nonlinear system. Instead, we first compute the affine transformations implicitly defined for all the Laplacian coordinates by solving a large sparse linear system, and then extract the rotation and uniform scaling information from each solved affine transformation. Unlike existing differential-based mesh editing techniques, our method produces visually pleasing deformation results under large angle rotations or big-scale translations of handles. Additionally, to demonstrate the advantage of our editing framework, we introduce a new intuitive editing technique, called configuration-independent merging, which produces the same merging result independent of the relative position, orientation, scale of input meshes. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},
