\chapter*{Abstract}

The recent advancements in virtual reality (VR) have resulted in many new virtual reality applications. One group of applications targets 3D modeling in VR. This thesis addresses the development of a novel sketch-based 3D modeling tool in VR. Sketch-based modeling aims to provide the user with a very intuitive and simple way of creating 3D models, and is based on the way that humans draw 2D shapes with pen and paper. 

The developed system is based off the sketch-based modeling tool FiberMesh~\cite{Nealen2007} and essentially brings it to the Oculus Rift. The system is built into the mesh viewer of libigl ~\cite{Jacobson2017}, which is also ported to the Oculus Rift as part of this thesis. With our software the user can draw an outline, which will then inflate to a rough 3D model. The drawn strokes stay on the model surface and serve as deformation handles. The user can add and remove extra control curves, as well as deforming them. Finally the user can edit the mesh topology by performing cuts or extrusions. 

We show that our software is very easy to learn and intuitive, and that novice users can quickly generate 3D models with it. Also we show that this application greatly benefits from the 3D setting that comes with VR, since it allows users to do out-of-plane editing in a faster and more intuitive way.
