\chapter{Introduction}
Digital 3D shape modelling is a field that has received a lot of attention over the past years as a result of increasing rendering possibilities and a growing call for digital content. The recent surge in interest for VR (Virtual Reality) has driven the development of better GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) even more, while also further increasing the demand for digital 3D content. 
The process of 3D shape modelling has so far been almost exclusively suitable for trained professionals or users with a lot of experience. While 3D modelling software generally comes with plenty of options and possibilities it also usually has a steep learning curve. This causes 3D modelling to become inaccessible to novice users who would like to develop some 3D content, but who do not have the time to learn how to use these programs. 

Sketch-based 3D modelling seeks to simplify the process of 3D modelling in order to make it more accessible to this user group. Its goal is to provide the user with intuitive ways to interact with the mesh that is being modelled. Previous work regarding sketch-based modelling tools has produced multiple software products which  present the user with this intuitive method of 3D modelling. 

Recently a variety of art creation tools for usage in VR have been created. These applications range from painting in 3D to voxel modelling and 3D sculpting. VR gives artists the possibility to look at what they're creating from a literally new perspective. Directly modelling in 3D gives a better feeling of the proportions of different parts of a model and for example the angles between them.

The goal of this thesis is to develop a sketch-based 3D modelling program for usage in VR. This combines the intuitivity of sketch-based designing and the emersiveness of modelling in actual 3D space and the possibility of viewing the results immediately in 3D. The software is targeted to user that are new to 3D modelling and should therefore be straightforward to use and easy to learn.
